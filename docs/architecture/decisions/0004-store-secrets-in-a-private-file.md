# 4. Store secrets in a private file

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Coding agents in a sandbox need tokens for GitHub, Claude Code and GitHub
Copilot. A token in the guest's environment can be read and leaked by the
agent or by anything it runs, so the real value shouldn't enter the VM.

microsandbox's secrets feature solves this inside the VM. The guest gets a
placeholder such as `$MSB_GH_TOKEN` in the secret's environment variable,
and the TLS proxy on the host replaces the placeholder with the real value
in requests to the secret's allowed hosts. Requests that carry the
placeholder to other hosts are blocked. Each secret needs at least one
allowed host.

microsandbox (0.7.6, and 0.7.7 at the time of writing) accepts a secret's
value in two ways:

- **Inline value** - `.value(..)`. microsandbox stores it in plaintext in its
  sandbox database, `~/.microsandbox/db/msb.db`.
- **Source reference** - `.source(SecretSource::Env { var })`. The database
  stores only the reference, and microsandbox resolves it from the
  environment of the process that boots the sandbox, which is `anvild`.
  `SecretSource::Store`, for a host-side secret store, isn't implemented
  yet.

We considered two options:

- **A: inline values in private files** - `anvild` keeps the secrets in
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/anvil/secrets.yml` (mode `0600`), passes the values
  inline, and makes microsandbox's `db` directory `0700`.
- **B: OS keyring with an environment source** - `anvild` keeps the secrets
  in the keyring (Secret Service), loads them into namespaced environment
  variables such as `ANVIL_SECRET_GH_TOKEN` before its tokio runtime starts,
  and passes `SecretSource::Env` references. `set_var` is only sound before
  other threads exist, so setting a secret has to restart `anvild`.

| | A: inline value, private files | B: keyring + environment source |
|---|---|---|
| At rest | Plaintext in `secrets.yml` (`0600`) and `msb.db` (`db/` is `0700`). | Encrypted in the keyring. No plaintext on disk. |
| Other users on the host | Blocked by file permissions. | Blocked. |
| Malware running as the user | Can read both files. | Can query the unlocked keyring, or read `/proc/<pid>/environ` of `anvild`. |
| Backups, a stolen unencrypted disk | Exposed. | Protected. |
| Changing a secret | `anvild` updates each sandbox through `modify()`. | `anvild` restarts and drops open `anvil run` and SSH sessions. |
| Cost | No new dependency. | The `keyring` crate, a desktop keyring, `unsafe` `set_var` and a restart protocol. |

Both options keep the value out of the VM equally well. They differ only in
how the value is protected on the host, and neither protects against
malware that runs as the user.

## Decision

We use option A. The keyring adds complexity without protecting against the
threat that matters, malware running as the user. With full-disk encryption,
the remaining gain of option B, protection at rest, is small.

- `anvil secret set <name> [<value>] [--from-stdin] [--allow-host <host>]...`
  sends the secret to `anvild` through the `SetSecret` RPC.
- `anvild` validates the name (an environment variable name that doesn't
  start with `MSB_`), the value (not empty) and the allowed hosts (host names,
  optionally `*.`-prefixed; `*` isn't allowed). Without `--allow-host`, it
  uses defaults for well-known names:

  | Name | Default allowed hosts |
  |---|---|
  | `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `uploads.github.com` |
  | `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `*.githubcopilot.com` |
  | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | `api.anthropic.com` |

- `anvild` stores the secret in `secrets.yml`, writing a `0600` temporary
  file and renaming it, and adds it to every sandbox it created (the ones
  with an `anvil.hostname` label) with `modify().secret(..).next_start()`.
  New sandboxes get all stored secrets when they're created. microsandbox
  enables TLS interception for sandboxes with secrets.
- `anvil secret ls` lists the names and allowed hosts, never the values.
  `anvil secret rm` removes a secret from the sandboxes with
  `modify().remove_secret(..).next_start()`, and then from `secrets.yml`.
  When a sandbox fails, the secret stays in `secrets.yml`, so running
  `anvil secret rm` again retries it.
- On startup, `anvild` sets the microsandbox `db` directory to `0700`.

## Consequences

- The real values never enter the VM. A running sandbox gets a new or
  changed secret the next time it starts. A running sandbox also keeps a
  removed secret until it restarts, because microsandbox can't reconfigure
  secrets live yet.
- The values are in plaintext at rest, readable by every process that runs
  as the user. **When the host may be compromised, rotate the secrets** at
  their issuers (GitHub, Anthropic) and set the new values with
  `anvil secret set`. Changing them in anvil alone doesn't help, because the
  old values may already have been copied.
- microsandbox only substitutes placeholders in HTTP headers. Tools that send
  the token in a header (`gh`, the GitHub and Anthropic APIs) work. `git`
  over HTTPS doesn't, because it sends the token base64-encoded in Basic
  auth, where the placeholder isn't visible.
- Tools that check a token's format before using it may reject the
  placeholder.
- When microsandbox implements `SecretSource::Store`, we can revisit this
  decision without changing the CLI.
