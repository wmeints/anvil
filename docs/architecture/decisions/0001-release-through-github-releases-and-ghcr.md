# 1. Release through GitHub releases and GHCR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Users need prebuilt `fbk` and `fbkd` binaries and the `firebrick-base` sandbox
image without building them from source. The CLI starts `fbkd` from its own
directory, so both binaries must ship together. The code uses unix sockets and
unix signals, and microsandbox only runs on Linux with KVM, Apple Silicon macOS
and, in preview, Windows. This conflicts with the constraint that the
application must work on Mac, Linux and Windows
([Constraints](../02-constraints.md)).

## Decision

A tag matching `v*.*.*` triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Builds both binaries natively on GitHub-hosted runners for
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and
  `aarch64-apple-darwin`, instead of cross-compiling, so the protobuf and
  microsandbox build scripts run on the platform they target. The Linux builds
  run on Ubuntu 22.04 so the binaries need glibc 2.35 at most.
- Packages each target as a `tar.gz` with both binaries in one directory.
- Pushes the `firebrick-base` image to GitHub Container Registry, tagged with
  the git tag, for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, after every package has
  built.
- Publishes the workspace crates to crates.io before the GitHub release, added
  by
  [ADR 0031](0031-publish-the-crates-to-crates-io-with-trusted-publishing.md).
- Creates a GitHub release with generated notes once all of the above pass.

Windows is left out until the CLI and daemon are ported off unix-only APIs.

## Consequences

- A release needs no secrets beyond the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The crates.io
  publish of
  [ADR 0031](0031-publish-the-crates-to-crates-io-with-trusted-publishing.md)
  keeps this true: Trusted Publishing gets a short-lived token from the
  workflow's OIDC token instead of a stored secret.
- The release only appears when every package and the image succeed, and the
  image is only pushed when every package succeeds. An image push can still
  succeed while the release step fails.
- Users install the microsandbox runtime themselves, in the version that matches
  the `microsandbox` crate; the archives don't bundle it. Superseded by
  [ADR 0002](0002-embed-the-microsandbox-runtime-in-anvild.md): `fbkd` now
  embeds the runtime.
- The `firebrick-base` package must be made public once after its first push.
- Windows users can't install firebrick from a release, which leaves the Windows
  constraint unmet (see
  [Risks and technical debt](../11-risks-and-technical-debt.md)).
