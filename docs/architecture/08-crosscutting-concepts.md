# Crosscutting concepts

## Error reporting in the daemon

The daemon doesn't send the errors of microsandbox, the secret store or the SSH
server to the client. It replaces them with a short, generic message, such as
`failed to remove sandbox`, and a matching gRPC status code. Wherever it does
that, it first logs the original error with `tracing::error!(error = ?err,
"<message>")`, naming the sandbox, secret or host name involved. The error is
logged with its `Debug` representation, because the `Display` representation of
these errors leaves out their source, which is what's needed to debug an
internal error. The log is written to the console and to `fbkd.log` in the
daemon's log directory.

A failure the user can cause and fix, such as connecting to a stopped sandbox,
is logged as a warning instead, so it doesn't hide real internal errors.

Because the `Debug` representation includes every source, an error type must not
carry secret values anywhere in its chain. serde_yaml quotes the values it can't
parse, so a parse error of the secrets file only keeps the line and column of
the error, not the serde_yaml error itself.
