# Implement feature

Agree on what to build before building it, then build the minimum that meets the
spec, test-first.

## Steps

### 1. Understand the problem

- When the work comes from a GitHub issue, read it with one command:

  ```sh
  gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels,comments
  ```

  Plain `gh issue view <N> --comments` prints only the comments.
- Read the architecture docs in `docs/architecture/` to understand how the
  project is structured, then read the code the feature touches. If the project
  has no `docs/architecture/` directory, rely on `CLAUDE.md` instead.
- Walk the implementation ladder from `CLAUDE.md`. If the feature doesn't need
  to be built, or already exists, say so and stop.

### 2. Write a spec and confirm it

When the issue has the `design-ready` label, its body is the agreed spec: don't
write a new one or ask for approval again. Ask only about gaps or conflicts with
the code, then continue with step 3.

Otherwise, present a short spec to the user and wait for approval before writing
code:

- **Goal**: the problem it solves and for whom.
- **Behavior**: the commands, flags, API messages, or output that change, with
  an example of each.
- **Errors**: what can go wrong and what the user sees in that case.
- **Design**: the modules that change and their public interface. Prefer
  extending a deep module over adding a new shallow one.
- **Out of scope**: what this change deliberately doesn't do.
- **Tests**: the unit and integration tests that prove the behavior.

Ask about anything the spec can't answer from the request or the code.

### 3. Write the tests

- Write tests against the public interface for each behavior and error in the
  spec.
- Mark integration tests as described in `CLAUDE.md`, so they can be run
  separately from the unit tests.
- Run them and confirm they fail.

### 4. Implement

- Write the minimum code that makes the tests pass.
- Follow the coding guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Follow the configured linter rules.
- Add new dependencies only when the spec names them.

### 5. Update the docs

- Update the architecture docs that describe the changed behavior, such as the
  building block view or runtime view.
- Add a decision record to `docs/architecture/decisions/` for new dependencies
  or architectural choices, and list it in `docs/architecture/09-decisions.md`.
  Number it after the newest record on `origin/main` and on your branch, so it
  doesn't collide with one merged in the meantime:

  ```sh
  git fetch origin
  git ls-tree --name-only origin/main docs/architecture/decisions/
  ```
- Update `README.md` when the usage of the project changes.

### 6. Verify

- Run the format, lint, and test commands from `CLAUDE.md`, and the `vm-tests`
  integration tests when `crates/daemon` changed. Fix any failures.
- Report what you built, how it maps to the spec, and anything you left out.
- When the work comes from an issue, end the commit message with `Closes #<N>`.
