//! Opens http and https URLs from sandboxes in the browser on the host.
//!
//! Each running sandbox gets one relay: a shell loop, started as an exec stream, that reads URLs
//! from the FIFO at [`FIFO_PATH`] and echoes them to stdout. The `firebrick-open` stand-in for
//! `xdg-open` in the `firebrick-base` image writes to that FIFO. fbkd reads the relay's output
//! line by line, checks each URL and hands it to an [`Opener`]. It never opens a URL whose host
//! is the host itself or its local network, or one the sandbox's enforced egress rules don't
//! allow, so the browser can't be used to get around them.
//!
//! OAuth logins in the sandbox send the browser to a `redirect_uri` on `localhost:<port>`,
//! where a callback server in the sandbox waits. Before fbkd opens such a URL, or one whose own
//! host is `localhost:<port>`, it forwards the host's `localhost:<port>` to the same port in
//! the sandbox with [`CallbackForwards`], so the browser reaches the sandbox instead of the
//! host. A URL whose own host is loopback only opens when that forward is open.
