//! Port forwarding: listens on host loopback ports and forwards each connection to a port on a
//! sandbox's loopback.
//!
//! [`Forwards`] reconciles the open forwards of a sandbox with a list of [`PortMapping`]s. Each
//! forward listens on `127.0.0.1:<host>`, and on `[::1]:<host>` when the host has IPv6
//! loopback, and hands accepted connections to a [`Connector`]. [`SshConnector`] reaches the
//! guest port through a `direct-tcpip` channel of the sandbox's SSH server, which agentd opens
//! from inside the guest. One SSH session per sandbox carries all channels.
//!
//! [`CallbackForwards`] opens forwards of one sandbox on demand, such as for the OAuth callback
//! port of a URL the sandbox opens on the host, and closes each one after it's idle.
